## What app does

This project involves developing a Streamlit-based web application that integrates advanced technologies like Stable Diffusion, ControlNet, OpenPose, and OpenVINO for real-time human pose estimation. Users can upload images to the app, which then employs OpenPose for detecting human figures and their poses. The app further utilizes the combined capabilities of Stable Diffusion and ControlNet to modify or highlight these poses. The final output displays the original image alongside a version with pose annotations, offering an interactive and visual representation of human poses. This setup not only showcases the intersection of deep learning and image processing but also makes advanced pose estimation techniques accessible to users via a simple web interface.
